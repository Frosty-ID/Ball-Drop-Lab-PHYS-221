# Ball-Drop-Lab-PHYS-221

Overview
This project investigates the motion of a tennis ball in free fall by comparing experimental data with theoretical predictions. The experiment involved dropping a tennis ball from five different heights and recording the time it took to hit the ground. For each height, five trials were conducted to ensure accuracy and obtain multiple data points. The recorded times were then compared to the theoretical free-fall times calculated using the laws of physics.
