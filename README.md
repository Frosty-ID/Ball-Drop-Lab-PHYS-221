# Ball-Drop-Lab-PHYS-221

Overview

This project investigates the motion of a tennis ball in free fall by comparing experimental data with theoretical predictions. The experiment involved dropping a tennis ball from five different heights and recording the time it took to hit the ground. For each height, five trials were conducted to ensure accuracy and obtain multiple data points. The recorded times were then compared to the theoretical free-fall times calculated using the laws of physics.


### Experimental Procedure:

Heights Used: 0.5 meters, 0.9 meters, 1.25 meters, 2.0 meters, and 2.5 meters.
Trials: At each height, the ball was dropped 5 times, yielding 5 sample times per height.
Objective: To observe the variation in experimental results and compare them to the theoretical free-fall times, calculated based on the equation of motion under gravity.

### Theoretical Time Calculation:
The theoretical time for a ball dropped from a given height was calculated using the equation:

$$
t = \sqrt{\frac{2h}{g}}
$$

Where:
- \( t \) is the theoretical time.
- \( h \) is the height from which the ball is dropped.
- \( g \) is the acceleration due to gravity, 9.81 m/s squared.
